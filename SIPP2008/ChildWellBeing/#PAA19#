Parental divorce is associated with an increased risk of high school dropout and lower levels of educational attainment. Although some of this association is likely related to the fact that divorce leads to reduced resources available to children, some may be because family instability contributes to stress and disrupts household discipline and routine. Other forms of household instability, such as the birth of a sibling, having a grandparent move in, or residential moves might also be sources of stress and disruption. If so, they may also be associatd with associated with children's educational outcomes.

The goal of this study is to investigate whether household instability is associated with children's educational performance. We are interested in whether all forms of household instability are equally associated with children's educational performance, parental instability is especially relevant.
** Could add more about conceptual framework.

Background

In the United States families matter for children's development and well being. Society sees biological parents as the ones primarily responsible for child care and upbringing. Generally, we expect children to live with their biological parents and deviations from the arrangement make it less likely that children will benefit from their parents' resources. Many studies have shown a connection between parental divorce, declines in the amount or resources available to children in terms of both time and money, and lower educational attainment. Parental divorce may matter for child well being not only because of the reduced resources available to children, but also because the process of divorce contributes to stress and disrupts household routines. 

Family instability, arising from parental divorce and new relationship formation, is associated with poorer educational outcomes for children. Family Stress Theory explains this association by arguing that family transitions create stress and disrupt routines. This can make parenting more difficult and can hinder children's ability to do well in school. Many studies have provided evidence to support this theory, often by linking the number of maternal marital or cohabiting relationship transitions to child development. Studies of family instability usually count a transition into a two-parent family the same as a transition out, despite the fact that the experiences of these transitions is likely very different. When a child gains a stepparent, the household will typically experience a gain in resources, more strongly resemble the ideal typical family. A transition (back) into a single parent family is likely to involve a reduction in resources. The only consistency is that both transitions might involve some stress and conflict, not just among the adults but also adults and children

Most research finds little evidence, however, that transitions out of a two-parent family are worse for child outcomes than transitions in, providing a lot of support for the idea that family stability and routine is important. A few studies, however, find some differences between the effects instability due to divorce relative remarriage. The lack of consistency across studies is related to the fact that a relatively small proportion of children experience multiple disruptions. 

A closer evaluation of household composition changes can provide insights about the underlying dynamics of household resource and household routine changes as well as their possible influences on child outcomes. Although prior research has established that parental instability has a profound impact on child well-being (Fomby and Cherlin 2007), few studies have examined to what extent instability caused by people other than parents matters. It s clear that household instability remains an unaccounted factor in children s developmental contexts (Perkins 2017). Whether all changes in household compositions are equally important or whether certain types of changes are more important to children s well-being than others remains unknown. To address this gap, this study assesses whether household instability is associated with academic performance among U.S. households with children. Specifically, we analyze whether household instability is associated with children's risk of repeating and grade and their interest in school, as well as parent's educational expectations. Our measure of household instability considers everyone, not just parents. 

Study design
Data and Method
This study uses nationally representative data from the 2008 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). SIPP interviews respondents every four months for four years. Each interview includes a repeated set of core questions and changing modules of topical questions. Much of our analysis is based on data from wave 4 (conducted in late 2009) and wave 10 (conducted two years later) because information on children's educational performance is collected in these two waves. Analyses using data from Waves 4 and 10 are limited to 8265 children age 7 to 15 in Wave 4 who are also observed in Wave 10. In addition, we use data from the core interviews in all waves to measure high school drop out.  The sample for the analysis of high school dropout is limited to XXXX cases who were age 15-17 at any point during the SIPP panel and who were observed at least three waves.

Measures
Our first measure of educational performance is whether the child repeated a grade. The primary caretaker for each child (or proxy) is asked whether the child has repeated any grades or been held back for any reason. The same question was asked in Waves 4 and 10 and we expected that all children who had a repeated a grade in Wave 4 would have still repeated a grade in Wave 10. This is not the case. ***add information about percentages ***

The second measure of educational performance is high school dropout. This outcome is determines from two variables on the core survey: current enrollment and educational attainment. We code individuals who are no longer enrolled but do not have a high school degree as drop outs. Unlike the measure of grade repeating, the measure of dropping out is available in every SIPP interview, or every four months for individuals observed in every wave.

In addition, investigate two measures of children's attitudes toward school. The first is based on the primary caretakers response to a question about whether a statement that [child] is interested in school work is not true, sometimes true, or often true. The second is based on a question of whether the child like school. These are available only in Waves 4 and 10. These variables provide some insight into why household instability is associated with grade repeating and dropping out. 

Our primary independent variables measure household instability. For analyses of grade repeating and attitudes toward school, the household instability measures indicate experiences between Wave 4 and Wave 10. A set of four measures indicate whether any 1)parent 2) sibling or 3) other household member entered or left the household or 4) whether the child changed address. These indicators are not mutually exclusive, although we investigated models with mutually exclusive measures. That is, we had indicators of whether one experienced a parent change and a sibling change, a parent change only, a parent change with an other change, etc. The pattern of results suggested that these four indicators capture the relevant variation. In addition, we investigated more detailed measures of household changes, separating out sibling births (i.e. a sibling aged 0 enters the household) from adult siblings leaving the household and other sibling changes. For our analysis of high school dropout, we use measures of household instability between one wave and the wave previous to predict high school droppout before the following wave. This approach is appropriate if we believe that household instability has immediate effects on dropping out and it might. [But we should consider more cumulative measures of household instability after PAA].

Another set of independent variables describe household structure, whether there are two, one, or no parents, whether any other adults are in the household, and number of children in the household. Our models include controls for child age, sex, race, parental education, and household poverty status.

Table 1 presents information on the independent variables for the two analytical samples. Table 2 presents distributions on the outcome variables overall and by each of the household instability measures. Overall few children repeat a grade and most like school and are interested in school work. A very small proportion of students drop out of high school before age 18. Children that experience household instability tend to be more likely to have repeated a grade, to not like school, to be uninterested in school work or to drop out of high school.

Note that these descritives include some individuals not included in the multivariate analysis because they are missing on the dependent variable or because they are observed in only one wave and thus aren't included in the event-history analysis. Future drafts will refine this.
