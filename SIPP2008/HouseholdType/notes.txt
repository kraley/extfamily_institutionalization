We have a puzzling finding that for whites, but not other race/ethnic groups, grandparent households are less stable than aunt/uncle households. To investigate this we first estimated models without household size because this is a linear term and extreme values might be creating distortions. After dropping hhsize we had the same pattern.

So I decided to estimate zero-order models for each independent variable by race-ethnicity. The results of these can be found in a series of spreadsheet files, one for each race/ethnic group.

For non-Hispanic whites grandparent households are now more stable than aunt/uncle households. Here's a quick chart of the results, since I'm not able to automate that easily.

Zero order associations between household composition and household instability
     	   		white	black	  hispanic    asian
grandparent		1.66	1.20	  1.10	      1.53
aunt/uncle		2.04	1.35	  1.31	      2.20
otherrel		1.85	1.42	  1.56	      2.04
nonrelative		1.76	1.80	  1.25	      2.14
All of these coefficients are statistically significant.
