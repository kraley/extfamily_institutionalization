To run all currently maintained SIPP2008 code:
do do_all.do
This will take a while, maybe around 1/2 hour.

As you will see in the do_all.do file, you must execute
project_macros.do in order to define some macros required
for the SIPP2008 code.  So, if you want to execute some of
the code in isolation (or test new code), best practice is
to execute project_macros.do, then use do_and_log as demonstrated
in do_all.do to execute each do file.
