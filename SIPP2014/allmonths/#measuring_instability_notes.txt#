We want to measure trends in children's household instability beyond 2013.
There was a major change in the SIPP design and we suspect that the monthly (as opposed to triannually) will lead to a lower estimate of household instability.

Individuals who move into the house between interviews but are not present at the time of interview are less likely to be recorded. This might be especially true for extended kin and short-term cohabitations. 

Do we even capture "type 2" people in our measurement of household composition using current code?

First, describe annual measures of instability (comp_change) by child age and compare to measures based on the SIPP 2008.
