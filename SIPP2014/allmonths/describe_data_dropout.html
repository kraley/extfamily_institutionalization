<p>Data for our analysis come from the 2014 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The 2014 panel initiated a redesign of the SIPP where individuals in sampled households are interviewed every year and asked questions about household composition and school enrollment in every month of the previous year, as well as educational attainment at each interview. The first interview was in 2014 and asked questions about 2013; the last interview was in 2018, covering 2017.</p>

<p>The SIPP is a large (N=82,464), probability sample of the non-institutionalized U.S. population. The focus of this analysis is on individuals who were age 16-19 at any time between January 2013 and December 2017 (N= 5,808). Most states have compulsory schooling to age 16 and most who will graduate from high school will do so by age 19.</p>
<p>The primary dependent variable is school dropout prior to obtaintaing a high school degree. Many individuals who dropout of school will eventually obtain a diploma or GED, but dropping out of school is a sign of academic trouble that may have lasting consequences even if the person returns to school.</p>

<p>We omit from the analysis 1,193 individuals age 16-19 who had dropped out of school or had their high school degree at first observation, leaving    4,615 age 16-19. The data are censored at high school graduation or first dropout. In addition, we delete observations missing information on school enrollment, leaving us with   77,063 person-months at risk of high school dropout or graduation (4,549 adolescents).</p>

<p>Finally, we drop the first observation because we do not have a measure of household instability prior to this point, leaving us with a sample of    4,549 individuals and   74,653 months. We observe   755 individuals (16.8 percent of the sample) dropping out.</p>
