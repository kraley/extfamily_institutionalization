SIPP 2014 allmonths analysis create_HHchangeWithRelationships.do does not get enough parent_change hits

I've got 19604 parent==1 out of 134362 composition changes. that's fine except that many many more are other relative and non-relative. I don't trust these measures. Who are these "other siblings"? 

SIPP 2008 allmonths analysis needs to fix my_first_month to be first month of coresidence and then check merges work correctly.

I'm trying to get to a point where I have defensible estimates of children's household instability across time by maternal/parental education.

Also want to be able to break down sibling change by type of sibling.

fix do_all files to clean up temp files.

fix setup file so that all the directories make sense
